Driver had a hard time finding the passenger. So he calls her and realise it was a girl lying on the floor, looking at the sky. When she boarded the car, she was fully wet. (It was not raining and it was broad daylight) and later asked if she could smoke in the car. I asked the driver if she was drunk, but he said no. Neither did he dare to engage in a conversation with her. <br /><br />3. Driver picked up a person from IMH and the payment mode was cash. When the person alighted, driver did not dare to ask for payment because he was afraid the person was mentally unsound. <br /><br /><br />If these are not enough, here\u2019s my personal experience. <br />My Boyfriend and I took a share ride and when We boarded, there was a Chinese National couple. The female mentioned she was going to meet \u6d2a\u4fca\u626c and is nervous about it. on the car ride, she plays her ukelele and was singing. As it was quite tight (small car/ukelele takes up space), I told my Boyfriend who was sitting infront to help me let her know not to play the ukelele in the car. My boyfriend told her to stop playing and she was shocked. She asked her Boyfriend what my Boyfriend meant. She did indeed stop playing the ukelele.
